Title: Construct and Visualize TDA Mapper Graphs
Description: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a method of data analysis that 
  uses techniques from topology to analyze high-dimensional data. Here we
  implement Mapper, an algorithm from this area developed by Singh, MÃ©moli and 
  Carlsson (2007) which generalizes the concept of a 
  Reeb graph <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reeb_graph>.
