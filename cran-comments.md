## mappeR 1.1.0

Users were having issues installing the program due to the package `RCy3` from Bioconductor. That functoriality has 
been moved over to another branch, so the only dependencies are from CRAN and we should have a cleaner install across 
the machines in use. Anyone who wants to use Cytoscape can use `devtools` to pull from a designated branch of this program 
which includes the dependency.
