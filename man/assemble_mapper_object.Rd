\usage{
assemble_mapper_object(binclust_data, dists, binning = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{binclust_data}{A list of bins, each containing named vectors whose names are those of data points and whose values are cluster ids}

\item{dists}{A distance matrix for the data that has been binned and clustered.}

\item{binning}{Whether the output dataframe should sort vertices into "bins" or not. Should be true if using clustering, leave false otherwise}
}
\value{
A list of two dataframes, one with node data containing bin membership,
datapoints per cluster, and cluster dispersion, and one with edge data
containing sources, targets, and weights representing overlap strength.
