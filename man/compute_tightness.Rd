\title{Compute dispersion of a single cluster}
\usage{
compute_tightness(dists, cluster)
}
\arguments{
\item{dists}{A distance matrix for points in the cluster.}

\item{cluster}{A list containing named vectors, whose names are data point names and whose values are cluster labels}
}
\value{
A real number in \eqn{[0,1]} representing a measure of dispersion of a cluster.
}
\description{
Compute dispersion of a single cluster
}
\details{
This method computes a measure of cluster dispersion. It finds the medoid of the input data set and returns the sum of distances from the medoid scaled by the size of the data set. Formally, we say the tightness \eqn{\tau} of a cluster \eqn{C} is given by \deqn{\tau(C) = \dfrac{\displaystyle\sum_{i}\text{dist}(x_i, x_j)}{\left(|C| - 1\right)}} where \deqn{x_j = \text{arg}\,\min\limits_{x_j\in C}\, \sum_{x_i \in C, i\neq j}\text{dist}(x_i, x_j)} A smaller value indicates a tighter cluster based on this metric.
