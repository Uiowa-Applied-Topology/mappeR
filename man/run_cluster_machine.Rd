\item{dist_mats}{A list of distance matrices of each bin that is to be clustered.}

\item{method}{A string to pass to \code{fastcluster} to determine clustering method.}

\item{local_clustering}{Whether you want clustering to happen in a global (entire dataset visible) or local (only current level set visible) context. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list containing named vectors (one per bin), whose names are data point names and whose values are cluster labels (within each bin)
